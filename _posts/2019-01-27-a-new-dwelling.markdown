For a while now I have been considering starting writing down my ideas, forcing myself to think them
through and lay them out logically. I don't expect that these will be read by anyone but by
laying them bare I hope to take them more seriously than I would otherwise.

## Who am I?
My day job involves developing software for various nautical autonomous systems (underwater
robots!). This mainly involves managing a small team, writing and reviewing code (mostly C++), and
general interaction with many customers.

During my free time I enjoy learning and find it difficult not to be distracted by anything
even vaguely interesting. I play games, go to the gym, tinker in Rust, read books, cook, and have
recently starting reading up about gardening. There are many areas of these I could dive into but I
will leave that for the future. Enough about me.


## Plans

I have a few ideas for future posts, mostly revolving around robotics and rust. I would like to put
forth my general feelings towards ROS, what it does well and what can be improved. I will also at
some point dive into Rust and take a look at how it can help robotics and IoT move forward. I may
decide to talk about politics or cooking but that will depends how bold I'm feeling.

For now this is enough for a first post. It is probably the most boring and least read so who cares,
right? Asshole.

Next up will be fixing this theme to actually look good...
